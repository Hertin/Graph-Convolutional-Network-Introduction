# Graph-Convolutional-Network-Introduction
This is a simple introduction of graph convolutional network. In this introduction, I summarized three papers following the outline of this post ```https://www.zhihu.com/question/54504471```
  - (IEEE-2012) [David i Shuman] The Emerging Field of Signal Processing on Graphs
  - (NIPS-2016) [MichaÃ«l Defferrard] Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering
  - (ICLR-2017) [Thomas N. Kipf] Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks
  
When writing this presentation, I made clear some of my confusions about graph convolutional network and I hope this post could be of some use to anyone who is new to this topic.
